# Covid-19-Dashboard
Using Tableau to create an interactive dashboard for confirmed cases of covid-19 

# Description
Covid-19 has affected millions of people worldwide. To help visualize the how the numbers of confirmed cases has changed within a few months, I created this Tableau dashboard using a dataset from New York Times github. This dashboard has a date slider that can pinpoint the number of cases from that date and where each each of these cases are in the United States. The map shows by county the numerous clusters that has spread throughout America. There is a bargraph that shows the number of cases by state and all of the parts of the dashboard are interactive.
